# Spaceship Titanic - Machine Learning Prediction
This repository contains my solution to the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition, where the objective is to predict whether a passenger was transported to another dimension.

## Project Overview:
- Data Cleaning: I performed thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Modeling: I trained different machine learning models to predict the transportation status of the passengers using various classification algorithms and evaluated the model's performance.

## Key Steps:
- Data Exploration and Cleaning: Understanding the structure of the data and applying transformations to clean and prepare it for the model.
- Feature Engineering: Removing irrelevant or redundant data and applying encoding to object type columns.
- Model Training: Implementing and fine-tuning machine learning models to optimize prediction performance.
- Evaluation: Comparing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and ROC-AUC curve.
